This is supposed to be a professional portfolio for things that we've coded. The mock up looked pretty fancy and I'm a super boring person. I chose beige for the background color.
Anyway I tried at least. I'll want to come back to this later to fix it up better. Honestly, I didn't really like the mock up that we saw. I'm chucking out the about me section entirely.
About me should be a pop up that secretly installs bonzi buddy on your system. It's too late. The purple gorilla is already inside the house.

Hopefully I got everything that was on the assignment list. I don't recall receiving comments on the last assignment so I'm kind of shooting into the void here and it really doesn't like finding frisbies in its not yard.

For real though that acceptance criteria makes next to no sense to me. You know what you want and what we need to do. Why is it being stated that way. It's overly confrontational and yet confusing? How can you be confusing with capslock on?
