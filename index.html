  <!-- header section with name and links about me, work, contact, resume-->

  <!-- lets put the section headers over on the left and stack on shrinkage. sounds nifty -->
  <!-- section about me, general info -->
  <!-- include a picture and some talk about myself. don't acknowledge cthulhu -->

  <!-- section work, projects completed-->
  <!-- link to projects for the course. I guess I'll throw in my personal vb code and that glorified excel document -->

  <!-- section contact, email maybe some other stuff, but that seems a little sketch-->
  <!--probably just the email-->

  <!-- resume, for my resume. Maybe a download link?-->
