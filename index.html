        My name is Naomi Eckhoff. I've been around computers my entire life. That's not saying much
        anymore, but if it helps my first operating system was msdos. It pretty much taught me how to read.
        I've worked on a variety of projects off and on throughout the years. Mostly videogame hacking, but
        every once in a while I'd do something productive. Below this you'll find a few of my past projects.
        I have a favorite, but, well, hacker gotta hack.

        The best way to contact me would be to shoot me an email. As a person who has been on the internet
        before I don't feel comfortable including too much information. It's easy enough to find me as it is.
