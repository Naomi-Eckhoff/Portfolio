      <p>
        My name is Naomi Eckhoff. I've been around computers my entire life. That's not saying much
        anymore, but if it helps my first operating system was ms-dos. It pretty much taught me how to read.
        I've worked on a variety of projects off and on throughout the years. Mostly videogame hacking, but
        every once in a while I'd do something productive. Below this you'll find a few of my past projects.
        I have a favorite, but, well, hacker gotta hack.

      <h3> My Favorite Creation</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/Naomi-Eckhoff/filter-condition-access/tree/main">
        <img src="./assets/images/filterDatabase.jpg"
          alt="A small program written in VB and SQL to report the status of filters" class="top-project">
      </a>
      <p>
        Favorite being a very strong word here due to the evil it crawled from. It's meant to run on Microsoft Access
        and is written in
        VB and SQL.
        It takes data gathered on the conditions of roughly 300 filters then with the press of a button does all the
        thinking for you.
        Nothing has made me bang my head against the wall quite as hard as this one, but it is fully functional. So the
        wall lost that
        battle.

      <p>
        The best way to contact me would be to shoot me an email. As a person who has been on the internet
        before I don't feel comfortable including too much information. It's easy enough to find me as it is.
